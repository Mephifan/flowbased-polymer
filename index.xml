      <description>minimizing the gap between idea and its expression Flowbased-polymer is a polymer implementation (behaviour) of Flow-Based Programming (FBP). Separating the control flow of web applications from the actual software logic. Helping you to organize large web applications easier than traditional OOP paradigms.
Write your applications like you make the concept for your application. Normaly you draw a few components and some arrows to connect the components to describe your intention.</description>

      <description>Installation Before you can use the flowbased-polymer behavior you need to install it in your project.
bower install flowbased-polymer --save  Import the behavior in your component &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;import&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;../bower_components/flowbased-polymer/behaviour.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  Add the behaviour to your component
Polymer 1.x
{ behaviors: [Polymer.FlowBasedProgramming] }  Polymer 2.x
 &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; class MyComponent extends Polymer.mixinBehaviors([ Polymer.FlowBasedProgramming], Polymer.Element){ static get is() { return &#39;my-view1&#39;; } } window.customElements.define(MyComponent.is, MyComponent); &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;  Tipp
Do not forget to import and define the behaviour.</description>

      <description>Given following example: We have a button and some elements. We want to hide a element-to-hide, after the user presses the hide button.
When you want to this in classical polymer, you have a lot of steps to do. This is not bad, but sometimes it is just to much work.
First you have to register on the event, then you have to assign id&amp;rsquo;s to the target elements, write the function in javascript and call the function on the element you want to hide from the javascript.</description>

      <description>After reading Flow-based Programming, i wanted to
i: Not suited for ui&amp;rsquo;s,&amp;hellip;
minimizing the &amp;ldquo;gap&amp;rdquo; between idea and its expression
&amp;ndash; FBP&amp;rsquo;s orientation towards reuse also forces one to distinguish between a particular use of a component and its general definition. This may seem obvious in hindsight, but, even when documenting conventional programs, you would be amazed how often programmers give a fine generalized description of, say, a date routine, but forget to tell the reader which of its functions is being used in a particular situation.</description>
