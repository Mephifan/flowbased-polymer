      <description>Elements use events to communicate state changes up the DOM tree to parent elements. Polymer elements can use the standard DOM APIs for creating, dispatching, and listening for events.
FBP also provides a notation for events (bubbling [^^e] and non bubbling [^e]), which allow you to specify events declaratively.
On the first view, it does not make a lot sense to rename events. But imagine a simple controller component with 3 buttons labeled with play, pause and next.</description>
