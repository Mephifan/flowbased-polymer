      <description>Given following example: We have a button and some elements. We want to hide a element-to-hide, after the user presses the hide button.
When you want to this in classical polymer, you have a lot of steps to do. This is not bad, but sometimes it is just to much work.
First you have to register on the event, then you have to assign id&amp;rsquo;s to the target elements, write the function in javascript and call the function on the element you want to hide from the javascript.</description>
